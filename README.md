# **Mezzo Forte GeoXp**

## **Description**

Mezzo Forte GeoXp is a cross platform, cross environment js library that automates a geolocated tour.

It maps media contents to geographical locations, and automatically reproduces them based on configuration rules.

Itâ€™s meant to be used in any js environment, front or back end, regardless of the js framework or platform.

The library is made of modules, with the main one being "core", while plugin modules are available to implement platform specific features.

Plugins are not mandatory, one can use the core and develop its own code to provide gelocation and consume media events.

An API and methods documentation page is available [at this link](https://mezzo-forte.gitlab.io/mezzoforte-geoxp).

An example web app (code is in `/example-web` directory) is published [here](https://geoxp.netlify.app/).
