        Put on the headphones and press the button below to play a test sound and check its correct operation.
        <button id="test-sound-button" type="button" name="test-sound" style="display:block;"class="large-button dark-button my-4">TEST</button>

        <b class="mb-4">If you hear the test sound, switch to the next question.</b>
        <br>
        If you don't hear anything there can be three reasons:
        <ol class="my-4">
        <li>the phone volume is at minimum</li>
        <li>the headset is off</li>
        <li>the headset is on but not connected to the p</li>
        </ol>
        First check the volume using the buttons on the right side of the phone.
        Then check that the headset is on by briefly pressing the power button
        under your right ear: if the voice announces the battery charge level,
        the headset is on. If not, press and hold the same button to turn the
        headset on. As a final step, check that the Bluetooth on your phone is
        turned on: open the Android drop-down menu by sliding your finger down
        from the top of the screen. Now press and hold the bluetooth symbol to
        check the power and connection status. If necessary, try pairing with
        your headset again.
        If you are not able to solve the problem, please contact the Museum
        desk or, if you are in the park, call + <b>+39 3351017368</b>.
